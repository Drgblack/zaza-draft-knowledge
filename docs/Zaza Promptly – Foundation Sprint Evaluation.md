\|

\| \*\*1. Customer Definition\*\* \| \*\*Very strong.\*\* The product
scope identifies daily teacher communication pain across multiple
audiences: parents, students, colleagues, admins. Segments include
time-poor teachers, new educators, and ESL contexts. Each use case is
backed by granular scenarios like "report card comments" and "IEP
updates". \|

\| \*\*2. Problem Clarity\*\* \| \*\*Extremely clear.\*\* The product
addresses an emotional and logistical burden---writing hundreds of
thoughtful comments under time pressure. Teachers feel overwhelmed,
under-supported, and burned out by repetitive admin tasks. \|

\| \*\*3. Founder--Problem Fit\*\* \| \*\*High.\*\* Greg's background in
L\\&D and education technology clearly shapes the product's laser-focus
on pedagogical appropriateness, emotional tone control, and comment
quality. The product vision reads like it was built by someone living
these pain points. \|

\| \*\*4. Unfair Advantage\*\* \| \*\*Moderate to strong.\*\* The MVP
includes GPT prompt safety layers, multilingual output,
education-specific tone control, and snippet management. The full
product includes hallucination safety, analytics, and compliance
(FERPA/GDPR), which are rarely found in generic GPT wrappers. The
planned \*\*\"AI verification and trust architecture\"\*\* is a strong
moat. \|

\| \*\*5. Differentiation\*\* \| \*\*Clear and compelling.\*\* Most GPT
comment tools lack depth, education tuning, or school-level sharing.
Promptly focuses on trust, safety, cultural nuance, and tone control. It
also supports professional communication, IEPs, and behavioral
feedback---not just positive fluff. \|

\| \*\*6. Evidence of Demand\*\* \| \*\*Strong indirect signals.\*\*
While user testimonials are not yet available, the scope and wireframes
reflect lived teacher pain. Teachers already use Google Docs, ChatGPT,
and Pinterest to piece this together. The viral/social features suggest
strong sharing potential. \|

\| \*\*7. Market Size\*\* \| \*\*Substantial.\*\* Every teacher globally
has to write comments, especially in structured educational systems
(Australia, UK, US, Canada, India, etc.). Paid tiers for schools and
districts unlock B2B potential, and translation/localisation expands the
TAM. \|

\| \*\*8. Monetisation Clarity\*\* \| \*\*Very strong.\*\* MVP uses
5-free-comments/month freemium with Pro upgrades. Full monetisation
layers include snippet packs, school licensing, and analytics
dashboards. Even the MVP has Stripe-ready UI built-in. \|

\| \*\*9. Product Strategy & MVP Scope\*\* \| \*\*Well executed.\*\* MVP
offers just enough to be useful (comment generation, save, filter,
export, freemium), while the roadmap introduces viral loops,
collaboration, hallucination control, and AI coaching. Each phase builds
real user value and business value in parallel. \|

\## 🧠 Summary

Zaza Promptly is a high-confidence product with a well-scoped MVP, deep
user empathy, and strong strategic runway. It solves a real, frequent,
and emotionally loaded problem for educators in a way no generic tool
does. With thoughtful UX, gamification, multilingual support, and
hallucination safety in the roadmap, it stands out as a
\*\*\"must-have\" EdTech tool\*\* rather than a \"nice-to-have.\"

Its B2C-to-B2B funnel (teacher → team → school) and natural virality
(referrals, shared snippets, badge sharing) give it excellent growth
potential.
