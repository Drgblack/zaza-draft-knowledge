# 12. Education-Specific Intelligence Layer

-   **Class Brain (Persistent Student/Class Context):**\
    Secure, teacher-only data store of classes, students, and parent
    contacts. Used to personalise AI outputs without exposing sensitive
    data externally.

    The system detects which student/class a message refers to and
    enriches the GPT prompt with verified details.

-   **Fact-Aware Drafting (Advanced):**\
    Combine hallucination safeguards with Class Brain verification. If
    outputs deviate from stored facts, the system flags discrepancies
    and suggests edits.

-   **Zara Assistant (Trusted Guide):**\
    Zara explains AI suggestions, shows which facts were used, and
    invites teacher feedback on snippet quality.

**Zaza Core vs Vertical Layer Framework**

**Purpose**\
To ensure scalability across industries, Zaza products share a common
foundation ("Zaza Core") while plugging in domain-specific layers
("Brains") that personalise outputs for teachers, realtors, healthcare
professionals, and beyond.

**Core Features (Shared Across All Zaza Products):**

-   **Authentication** -- Firebase/Supabase reusable sign-in.

-   **AI Prompting Engine** -- Modular GPT integration, adaptable per
    vertical.

-   **Zara Assistant Layer** -- In-app persona for guidance,
    transparency, and feedback collection.

-   **Growth & Gamification** -- Streaks, badges, referrals to drive
    engagement and virality.

**Vertical Layers (Domain-Specific Brains):**

-   **Promptly (Education)**

    -   *Class Brain*: lightweight teacher-only student/class context.

    -   *Student/Parent Matching*: maps snippets to the correct student.

    -   *Fact-Aware Drafts*: grounded in verified class data.

-   **RealtyClose (Real Estate)**

    -   *Property Brain*: property listings, features, and client
        context.

    -   *Property Matching*: ties AI drafts to the correct listing or
        buyer.
